Paper format

Thank you for your contribution to the conference!

AsiaBSDCon 2026 is now accepting paper and tutorial proposal submissions.  There are three types of sessions: "paper," "tutorial," and "co-located event proposal."

For the "paper" session, an accepted paper will be published in the printed conference proceedings:
 - The initial submission requires an extended abstract of your paper in 500-1000 words in PDF for review by the program committee.
 - If it is accepted, you need to submit a full version, typically 4 or more pages in A4 size.
 - The topic includes technical development, user experiences, academic results, project management, social activities, anecdotes, and history in BSD-derived operating systems or open-source projects.  While the program committee also welcomes topics on the use of BSDs in enterprise, commercial presentations will be rejected.
- One of the authors is expected to give a 45-minute talk on-site.

If you are considering holding an event during the conference days, please submit a "co-located event proposal".  Please describe the details in a PDF file.  The organizing committee will contact you on the conditions, such as dates, location, and costs.
